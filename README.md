## Description

This webpage wis meant to serve as a portfolio for future employers to view projects I developed in the past
and projects I am currently working on. The motivation behind creating this webpage was to apply the HTML and CSS material covered in class
while also creating a space to hold all previous work. Some problems I faced while trying to develop the HTML was trying to figure out how to use flexbox to display the header and cards and what CSS properties were needed to accomplish the desired styling. The concepts of flexbox and grid haven't solidified in my brain quit just yet as I was starting to get the two confused. I know they are both essentially used to accomplish the same thing; to give the elements a layout. However, I'm getting my properties mixed up. I had to differentiate between parent properties and child properties and which element had to be target in the html to give me the styling I needed. 

In the end, I wasn't able to accomplish making my webpage look like the mockup and spent a lot of time looking through matierals, trying to google and find the right doc and just trying to absorb everything. I'm not sure if it was my approach or just not knowing what to tackle first.
